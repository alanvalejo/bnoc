### BNOC: A benchmarking tool to generate bipartite, k-partite and heterogeneous network models with overlapping communities

**About**

BNOC is a tool for synthesizing bipartite, k-partite and heterogeneous network models with varied features 
representative of properties from real networks. Multiple input parameters can be manipulated to create networks of 
varying sizes and with distinct community patterns in terms of number, size, balance, edge distribution intra- and 
inter-communities, degree of overlapping and cohesion, and degree of noise in the connection patterns.

**Usage**

BNOC may operate in two modes: 1. using explicit command line parameters (or options) or 2. using a JSON config file 
(JavaScript Object Notation).

**Command line parameters**

Parameters `-d`, `-m`, `-c`, `-x`, `-y` and `-z` are arrays of size L, where L is the number of layers. Parameter `p` 
is an array of array the probability of vertices in each community for each layer. Parameter `e` define the scheme of 
the networks, i.e., the connections type.

**JSON option**

    $ python bnoc.py -cnf options.json

JSON format: Data is in name/value pairs, separated by commas, curly braces hold objects and square brackets hold arrays.

```javascript
{
    "option": "value"
}
```

**Examples**

You can use a config file (.json) to specify the parameters, for instance:

A bipartite network with communities, overlapping and a small level of noise:

	$ python bnoc/bnoc.py -cnf input/bipartite-1.json

To help you visualize the networks generated by BNOC you can use the 
[PyNetViewer](https://github.com/alanvalejo/pynetviewer) software. Then, it is possible to plot the network using a 
bipartite layout. Line widths reflect the corresponding edge weights; red squares depict overlapping vertices; and 
colored circles indicate non-overlapping vertices and their assigned community. Layout file is in the PyNetViewer 
repository.
	
    $ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/bipartite-1-layout-1.json

![](img/bipartite-1-layout-1.png)

The same network with standard layout. Only overlapping vertices are highlighted.

    $ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/bipartite-1-layout-2.json
	
![](img/bipartite-1-layout-2.png)

A bipartite network with hard level of noise, unbalanced community sizes and no overlapping.

    $ python bnoc.py -cnf input/bipartite-2.json
    $ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/bipartite-2.json
    
![](img/bipartite-2.png) 
    
A bipartite network with small level of noise, balanced community sizes, no overlapping and many communities.    
    
	$ python bnoc.py -cnf input/bipartite-3.json
	$ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/bipartite-3.json
	
![](img/bipartite-3.png)	
	
A k-partite network with k=4 and overlapping.

	$ python bnoc.py -cnf input/kpartite.json
	$ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/kpartite.json
	
![](img/kpartite.png) 	
	
A heterogeneous network with k=3 layers and no overlapping.
	
	$ python bnoc.py -cnf input/heterogeneous.json
	$ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/heterogeneous.json

**Notes**

A graph is called disconnected if it has more than one component, i.e. if it is not connected. Following this concept,
consider two observations:

1. Dispersion (`d` and `m` parameters) controls the number of edges in the network based on the number of vertices.
Large networks, with tens of thousands of vertices, can be connected with a low dispersion, e.g., d = 0.3.
In contrast, networks with a few hundred vertices need a higher dispersion to be connected, e.g., d = 0.6. The number
of communities need be considered too. E.g., a network with 1,000 vertices and 100 communities can have a low number 
of valid edges, since edges between communities is unlikely. Therefore, in this scenario, the graph needs a higher
dispersion to be connected.

2. The noise (`n` parameter) depends on the number of edges in the network. E.g., n = 0.01 is low and easy if applied
in a small network with a few hundreds or thousands of edges and vertices. In contrast, n = 0.01 is high and hard if 
applied in a large network, with tens of thousands of vertices.

**Scalability**

BNOC can generate large-scale bipartite networks with tens or even hundreds of thousands of vertices and hundreds of 
millions of edges in a timely manner. See the original article [1] for details about complexity and scalability.

Important, save the output files in text format is slow. It is recommended save the result with numpy `.npy` object, 
see [numpy.save](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.save.html) for details.

For instance, a bipartite network with twenty thousand vertices (use `--show_timing` to print timing values):

    $ python bnoc.py -cnf input/input_bipartite_time_ncol.json

    $        Snippet       Time [m]       Time [s]
    $ Pre-processing            0.0         0.0213
    $     Build BNOC            0.0         2.6187
    $           Save            1.0         34.596

Note, the bottleneck of the Bnoc execution time is to save the output in a text format. To suppress this limitation you 
can process the network directly in the memory or save a `.npy` object using `--output_npy` or `-onpy` parameter.

    $ python bnoc.py -cnf input/input_bipartite_time_npy.json

    $        Snippet       Time [m]       Time [s]
    $ Pre-processing            0.0         0.0223
    $     Build BNOC            0.0         2.4116
    $           Save            1.0         0.2627

**Install**

> Pip
    
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

> Or Anaconda env

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate bnoc

> Or Anaconda create

    $ conda create --name bnoc python=3.7.2
    $ conda activate bnoc
    $ conda install -c anaconda pyyaml
    $ conda install -c conda-forge pypdf2
    $ conda install -c anaconda scipy

**Testing**

To check that routines are (probably) working properly:

    $ make test

Writing files is tested by exercising the script mode described in the *Usage* section above.
Created objects should probably be better tested, as directions of Bnoc usage.
File I/O can be tested by e.g. appropriatelly replacing the `bnoc.open` function.
